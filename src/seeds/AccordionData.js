          "Water supply is solely from a private well.  It is safe to drink but we suggest bringing bottled water.  Although we have a large storage water tank installed, please be aware that during certain nonspecific times of the year, the well can yield less water than normal.  Please practice water conservation to avoid loss of water.  Timing of water usage is essential because high usage will deplete the well before it can replenish.  The washing machine and the hot tub are the most detrimental to the well supply and use of these items should only take place during times when water use throughout the rest of the cabin is minimal.  After use of these items, the well will need to be replenished so please allow adequate time before additional heavy water use."
